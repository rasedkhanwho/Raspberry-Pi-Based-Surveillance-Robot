# Raspberry-Pi-Based-Surveillance-Robot
This project focuses on the development of a Raspberry  Pi-based surveillance robot, designed to detect motion, recognize faces, and alert users  in real-time.

The robot uses:
- **PIR sensor** for motion detection
- **Camera Module** for capturing live video feed
- **Pre-trained CNN model (dlib)** for face detection and recognition
- **Email alerts** with captured images for unknown faces
- **Motor driver and wheels** for mobility (optional)
- **GPIO control** for additional devices (e.g., LED indicators)
